# Phishing-Domains-DB
A list of phishing domains.  
 
It was previously used in the discord bot to protect the guilds from the attack of hacked accounts sending phishing links.
At this moment, discord has become a safe place, for about a year I have not seen the phishing links in discord (seems like discord developers have made an automatic moderation system that automatically bans such accounts, or all phishers have just disappeared).  
So I suspended the bot and reworked this repository under the database (previously it was associated with a discord bot)  
 
 
Feel free to use this db in your projects.
